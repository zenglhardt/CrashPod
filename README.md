# CrashPod: a bicycle helmet with an integrated crash detection and alert system

Prepared for Comp_Eng 495 Wearable and Mobile Computing at Northwestern University (Fall 2021)

## Summary:
Cycling is both an excellent form of exercise and an environmentally-friendly mode of transportation. Unfortunately, a serious bicycle crash can leave riders incapacitated and unable to call for help. The CrashPod integrates additional safety features into the traditional bicycle helmet, adding an accelerometer to detect high-impact crash events and GPS connectivity to keep track of the rider's location. An on-board cellular radio then automatically sends a SMS text to an emergency contact with a Google Maps link to the crash site. The system is powered by solar cells coupled with a rechargeable battery, enabling the rider to add the CrashPod to their daily cycling kit without requiring nightly charging or battery replacements.
